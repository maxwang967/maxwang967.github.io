I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science (National Pilot Software Engineering School), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China (to obtain P.h.D degree in June, 2025), supported by BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation. 

I'm also serving as a researcher at Weixin Group of Tencent, supported by 2025 Tencent Project Up. Before that, I served as a research intern supported by 2024 Tencent Rhino-bird Research Elite Program. 

My current main interests include personalized search & recommendation and spatio-temporal data mining. I have published several papers in top journals and conference proceedings, such as ICDE, SIGIR, TMC, T-ITS, IoTJ, IS, IJIS, T-IV and ICANN.
